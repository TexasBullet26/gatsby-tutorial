My name is Trey Lanzer.

Actually, I go by the name of Trey. My real name is GIII. I am a 29 year old full-stack web developer out of Dallas, Texas.

It is raining today and my family and I are supposed to go to a football game tomorrow. The game is Navy vs. SMU. My Dad graduated from the Naval Academy in 1976, so we will deffinitely be rooting for Navy!
